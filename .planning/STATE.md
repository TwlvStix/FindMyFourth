# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-01-14)

**Core value:** Component consistency — every button, card, input, and UI element looks and behaves the same way everywhere
**Current focus:** Phase 3 — Typography System Enhancement

## Current Position

Phase: 3 of 7 (Typography System Enhancement)
Plan: 03-01 COMPLETE (1 of 3 in Phase 3)
Status: 🚀 Phase 3 IN PROGRESS — Typography foundation enhanced
Last activity: 2026-01-16 — Completed 03-01-PLAN.md (Typography foundation enhancement)

Progress: ███████████████░ 33% of Phase 3 COMPLETE

## Performance Metrics

**Velocity:**
- Total plans completed: 7
- Average duration: ~33 minutes
- Total execution time: ~3.9 hours

**By Phase:**

| Phase | Plans | Total | Avg/Plan |
|-------|-------|-------|----------|
| 01-foundation-audit | 3/3 ✅ | ~180min | ~60min |
| 02-component-library-standardization | 3/4 🚀 | ~62min | ~21min |
| 03-typography-system | 1/3 🚀 | ~12min | ~12min |

**Recent Trend:**
- Last 3 plans: ~23min average (02-02: 52min, 02-03: 4min, 03-01: 12min)
- Plan 02-03 (input components): 4min (very fast - component creation + migration)
- Plan 03-01 (typography foundation): 12min (ultra fast - semantic styles + widget + docs)
- Trend: Foundation enhancement extremely fast when well-defined, component creation with migration averaging ~8min

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

**From Project Initialization:**
- Component consistency as core priority (biggest visual impact)
- Allow minor copy/functional tweaks (consistency sometimes requires small UX adjustments)
- Keep current visual identity (not a rebrand, just polish)

**From Plan 01-01 (Foundation Audit):**
- AppSpacing is the success story (100% adoption) - validates token approach
- AppTypography underutilized (50% adoption) - migration + documentation critical
- Border radius as highest priority missing token (affects all components, visual impact)
- Elevation/shadows as second priority (depth perception standardization)
- AppListTile is highest-priority missing component (50+ screens affected by list patterns)
- AppTextField as second priority (forms/inputs everywhere)
- Deprecate AppButton in favor of AppButtonEnhanced (two competing systems problem)
- game_joined_detailed is model screen (80/20 component ratio, full token adoption)
- Target metrics for Phase 2: 65% component adoption, 80% typography adoption
- 8-week Phase 2 roadmap: tokens (weeks 1-2), components (3-4), migration (5-6), adoption (7-8)

**From Plan 01-02 (Inconsistency Audit):**
- 40-50% spacing uses hardcoded values despite token availability (habit + convenience)
- Typography inconsistency spans 7 categories (fontSize, weight, color, spacing, tokens, semantic, responsive)
- Hardcoded hex colors (#FF0000, #FFFFFF) are CRITICAL issue (breaks dark mode)
- Missing semantic colors (success/warning/info) block proper AppColors usage
- Premium card pattern duplicated 30+ times - highest priority component extraction
- List item pattern repeated 50+ times - validates AppListTile as top priority
- 166 Container instances, 167 BoxDecorations indicate massive standardization opportunity
- Loading state duplication (22 instances) is quick win for AppLoadingIndicator
- Component extraction fixes multiple issues simultaneously (spacing + colors + theming)
- Token adoption prerequisite for component adoption (complete tokens before heavy component work)

**From Plan 01-03 (Standardization Roadmap):**
- 10 standardization themes identified: Missing tokens, typography adoption, color cleanup, spacing migration, component duplication, missing core components, legacy deprecation, state management, specialized components, shadows/gradients
- Top 3 priorities: AppListTile (blocks 50+ screens), token systems (blocks component work), component duplication cleanup (4,000+ lines)
- Phase 2-5 execution sequence mapped: 12 plans over 12-16 weeks conservative timeline
- Quick wins (8 items, ~8.5 hours) vs foundational work (5 items, ~17 hours) identified
- Recommended 2-week foundation sprint before Phase 2-5 execution
- Target metrics: Component usage 40%→65%+, Typography 50%→85%, Colors 80%→95%, Spacing 50-60%→90%
- Code reduction target: ~5,385 duplicate lines → ~500 in components (90% reduction)
- Success metrics defined: Quantitative (adoption %), qualitative (consistency 4.5/5), developer velocity
- AppTheme vs AppColors decision needed early in Phase 2 (blocks Phase 5 color cleanup)
- Parallelization opportunities: Typography/spacing can overlap with component work after tokens created

**From Plan 02-01 (Foundation Tokens):**
- ✅ Design token foundation 100% complete - all 8 token systems now exist
- 5 new token systems created: AppBorderRadius, AppElevation, AppOpacity, AppIconSize, AppDuration
- Border radius: 7 semantic values (xxs 2px to full 999px) - consolidated from 8 arbitrary values
- Elevation: 6 standard levels + 2 specialty glows (glowGold, glowGreen for premium features)
- Opacity: 6 values (subtle 0.05 to heavy 0.80) - covers backgrounds to overlays
- Icon sizes: xs 16px to xxl 48px (accessibility-aligned with 48px touch targets)
- Animation durations: instant 50ms to slow 400ms (Material Design based, modern bias)
- AppButton deprecated with comprehensive migration guide - gradual migration strategy
- AppButtonEnhanced destructive variant added (red error color for delete/remove actions)
- Discovery: AppButton never widely adopted - zero instances found in codebase (screens use AppButtonEnhanced or TextButton)
- All token files follow consistent pattern: scale + semantic shortcuts + design philosophy docs
- Foundation ready for Phase 2-5 component work - no token blockers remain

**From Plan 02-02 (Card Standardization + Components):**
- ✅ AppCard enhanced with premium and glass variants using design tokens
- AppCard.premium uses sunset gradient + gold glow shadow (VIP/featured content aesthetic)
- AppCard.glass uses BackdropFilter with true blur effect for modal overlays
- All AppCard variants now use design tokens (AppBorderRadius.md, AppElevation tokens)
- AppIconBadge created with 6 semantic variants (primary/accent/success/error/subtle/ghost) + 3 sizes
- AppSectionHeader created for standardized section headers (title/subtitle/icon/action)
- Migration deferred: Audit's "premium cards" use fairway gradient (30+ instances), different from plan's sunset gradient spec
- Components ready for organic adoption in Phase 3-4 screen refactors
- Pattern established: Variant-based components with semantic naming (not just visual)

**From Plan 02-03 (Input Components):**
- ✅ AppTextField and AppBadge components created with full design token integration
- AppTextField has 4 variants: outlined, filled, underlined, search (covers all input patterns)
- AppBadge has 6 semantic variants (success/warning/error/info/primary/subtle) + 3 sizes
- Used withValues(alpha:) instead of deprecated withOpacity() for Flutter 3.27+ compatibility
- edit_profile migration proves pattern works: 50 lines of decoration → 8 lines with AppTextField
- StatefulWidget with internal focus management eliminates manual focus tracking
- Filled variant works well for forms on colored backgrounds (better than outlined)
- Discovery: Many planned migration targets don't exist or have no text fields (create_game uses dropdowns, not inputs)
- Pattern established: Helper methods can wrap AppTextField for reusable form builders
- Proof-of-concept complete - migration pattern validated, ready for broader adoption

**From Plan 03-01 (Typography Foundation Enhancement):**
- ✅ Typography foundation enhanced with semantic styles and convenience widgets
- 11 semantic getters added to AppTypography (screenTitle, sectionHeader, cardTitle, cardSubtitle, helperText, errorText, timestamp, badge, buttonPrimary, buttonSecondary)
- 5 migration helpers (text10-text22) for gradual transition from hardcoded sizes to semantic styles
- AppText widget created with 19 semantic named constructors covering all typography patterns
- Migration helper naming (text10 vs size10) avoids conflicts with existing font size constants
- Semantic styles as getters aliasing base styles (screenTitle => headlineMedium) maintains consistency
- Comprehensive 166-line migration guide with examples, mapping table, anti-patterns, and target metrics
- Foundation ready for screen-by-screen migrations in Plans 03-02 and 03-03
- Target: 85%+ AppTypography adoption, eliminate GoogleFonts.outfit and AppTheme.override patterns
